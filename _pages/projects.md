### qubovert [(View on GitHub)](https://github.com/jtiosue/qubovert) [(View documentation)](https://qubovert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

I created qubovert, a Python package for dealing with binary optimization problems. It is particularly designed to aid in converting optimization problems to a form that can be solved with quantum annealers and quantum optimization algorithms. I also used it as a way to learn more about best software practices, such as continuous integration, code coverage, code quality, etc.

### autolight [(View on GitHub)](https://github.com/jtiosue/autolight)

I created autolight, a Python package for automatically making "highlight" videos.


### Contribution to SciPy [(View my pull request)](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/10648)

I am the author of [pull request number 10648](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/10648) on Python’s SciPy package. My contribution is included in the [1.5.0 release](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/releases/tag/v1.5.0) and later releases. The pull request implements an additional feature for SciPy’s minimization method. In my research of variational quantum algorithms, I devised a bounded version of the standard unbounded Powell minimization method and found to often perform much better than the other gradient-free minimizers. I then implemented this variant in SciPy’s software stack and created the pull request.


### qusetta [(View on GitHub)](https://github.com/qcware/qusetta)

I created qusetta, a Python package for translating between different quantum circuit representations, while I was at QC Ware.


### C++ quantum computer [(View on GitHub)](https://github.com/jtiosue/Quantum-Computer-Simulator-with-Algorithms)

To learn about quantum computing, quantum algorithms, and C++, I coded a quantum computer simulator and implemented many quantum algorithms, such as Shor's factorization algorithm, Grover's search algorithm, etc.


### Review calibration [(View report)](https://github.com/jtiosue/rcal/blob/master/report/review_calibration.pdf) [(View code)](https://github.com/jtiosue/rcal/)

Calibrating reviews from multiple reviewers over the course of multiple days with improvement taken into account.


### Hockey Stats [(View site)](https://jtiosue.github.io/HockeyStats/) [(View source)](https://github.com/jtiosue/HockeyStats)

A HTML/CSS/Javascript website hosted with GitHub pages to easily track ice hockey stats and keep notes while watching somebody play. The site stores cookies so that statistics are remembered even if the browser is closed. 


### Distance to Green [(View site)](https://jtiosue.github.io/PythonGames/DistanceToGreen/javascriptImplementation/index.html) [(View source)](https://github.com/jtiosue/PythonGames/tree/master/DistanceToGreen/javascriptImplementation)
A little HTML/CSS/Javascript website hosted with GitHub pages to determine the distance you are from the green.


### Numerical steppers [(View on GitHub)](https://github.com/jtiosue/QuadratureCandJulia)

I provide a general overview of implicit versus explicit and single- versus multi-step steppers for numerically solving differential equations. I implemented dozens of methods in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) which are included at the end of the paper (see the link). I explore several interesting systems, including geodesics around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, motion of a Kapitza pendulum, E cross B drift of a charged particle in perpendicular electric and magnetic fields, etc. See the report and code on the GitHub page. 


### Android application [(View on Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=main.distancetogreen) [(View source)](https://github.com/jtiosue/PythonGames/tree/master/DistanceToGreen)

Published Android application called "Distance to Green" on the Google Play store under the developer name "Eigenjoe" with monetized adds from AdMob. See the link for more information.


### Github blog comments [(View site)](https://jtiosue.github.io/GHBlogComments/) [(View source)](https://github.com/jtiosue/GHBlogComments/)

A simple javascript file hosted on my site to easily add comments to a blog by hosting the comments on Github pages.
