### Teaching

#### Volunteer tutoring (Oct 2020 - Oct 2022)

I tutor undergraduate physics students at the University of Maryland for one hour a week.

#### Teaching assistant (Aug 2016 - Dec 2016)

I was a teaching assistant for a semester of Physics II, Electricity and Magnetism at MIT responsible for tutoring and helping twenty students through problems and concepts and grading their assignments. I was referred to as “best TA ever” by several students in anonymous subject evaluations. 


### Research

#### Quantum algorithms researcher at QC Ware, Corp (Jan 2019 - Aug 2020)

I researched applications for near-term quantum computers (see [Publications](#publications)), researching real-world applications of quantum computers for various customer projects, and developed software for the QC Ware software platform (see [forge.qcware.com](forge.qcware.com)).

#### MIT Laboratory for Nuclear Science - Hen Lab (Sep 2017 - Dec 2018)

I studied proton vs neutron dynamics in asymmetric nuclei and short range deuteron clustering in nuclei. We worked in collaboration with Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator in Virginia, using data collected there for our analysis. I worked alongside a graduate student and perform data analysis using C++ and ROOT. This includes particle identification and various detector specific work such as acceptance and fiducial analysis for 3He and 4He(e,e’p) and (e,e’d) reactions. Our goal was to filter out inelastic reaction channels so as to compare quasielastic collisions with theoretical models. 


#### Los Alamos National Lab Quantum Computing Summer Fellowship (Summer 2018)

We developed a novel algorithm called Variational Fast Forwarding (VFF) for simulating quantum systems on a quantum computer beyond its coherence time. See [Publications](#publications) for our publication. 


#### Joint Quantum Institute, University of Maryland (Summer 2017)

Worked alongside a postdoc to model short and long range interacting fermionic spin chains and Kitaev wires, focusing on how magnetic field and interaction strength parameters affect the steady state of the system. We studied the relationship between dynamical and quantum phase transitions via quench dynamics in integrable and nearly-integrable systems. Our paper is on PRL and arXiv (see [Publications](#publications)). 


#### MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center (Jan 2016 - May 2016)

Worked with a professor to model particle acceleration and transport in turbulent media using C. We focused particularly on an electron’s E cross B drift about its guiding center in spatially and time varying fields.


#### MIT Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering (Sep 2015 - Dec 2015)

Worked with a graduate student to model thermal and mechanical responses of nuclear waste storage canisters to Traveling Wave Reactor (TerraPower) fission waste using finite element software ADINA. We tested a proposed pin and filler structure against the model we generated. 



### Other

#### Skate guard and ice hockey referee (Feb 2016 - Dec 2018)

I was a skate and ice hockey referee for MIT Intramural for most of my time at MIT. I also played on multiple teams.


#### Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy (Jan 2016)

I interned at Space and Defense Power Systems. I shadowed the Director of Space and Defense Power Systems, learning about the DOE’s task of ensuring containment of nuclear material during NASA launches with Radioisotope Power Systems on-board. I used HTML/CSS to design a website that presents information on the department to the public.


#### Meadows Farms Nursery and Landscape (Mar 2013 - Mar 2015)

Laborer.
